I am a cybersecurity architect and researcher with a PhD (Dr.rer.nat.) in Computer Science from   Freie Universität Berlin. My work focuses on the intersection of secure system design, digital identity infrastructure, and regulatory compliance—drawing on expertise in post-quantum security, IoT, and next-generation wireless networks.

My academic path includes a joint master’s degree in ICT Innovation from Sorbonne Université and Technische Universität Berlin, where I combined deep technical training with entrepreneurial thinking. Throughout my career, I’ve worked across diverse innovation ecosystems—including Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, BNP Paribas Cardif’s Innovation Lab. I’ve led technical work in European cybersecurity projects like AUTOKEY, SecureFog, and UltraSec, contributing to advancements in privacy-preserving authentication, secure device onboarding, and post-quantum readiness.

I actively contribute to EU-level working groups on 5G and 6G security and specialize in architecting compliant, vendor-neutral, and future-proof cybersecurity systems. My technical focus areas include  verifiable credentials, attribute-based cryptography, and physical-layer security.

Outside of research and architecture, I enjoy reading and writing—preferably with a strong Americano (two shots). In 2016, I published my first book, a personal travelogue capturing stories from across borders and networks.
