I am a doctoral researcher in the Cybersecurity and AI group at Freie University Berlin. My research interests include Post-Quantum Privacy and Security, the Internet of Things (IoT), Next Generation Mobile Networks, and Ontology. I pursued double Master's degrees in Information and Communications Technology at Sorbonne University in France and Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Technische Universit√§t Berlin in Germany.

Throughout my career, I had the opportunity to work with some of the most renowned organizations in the field. In between my studies, I worked at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute in the Wireless Communications research group. I also worked at the Cardif Innovation Lab of BNP Paribas Cardif. Additionally, I worked at Grameenphone Ltd., a subsidiary of the Telenor Group in Norway.

I enjoy reading and writing over a cup of good Americano with two shots. From time to time, I write short essays and stories. In 2016, I published  my first book which is a compilation of travel experiences.
