I am a cybersecurity architect and researcher with a PhD (Dr. rer. nat.) in Computer Science from Freie Universität Berlin. I design security architectures that anticipate the threats of the post-quantum world. My work bridges digital identity, quantum-safe protocols, and AI-powered security agents—with the goal of building systems that defend, adapt, and scale under next-generation threat models.

My academic path includes a joint Master’s degree in Information and Communication Technology from Sorbonne Université in France and Technische Universität Berlin, where I combined deep technical training with entrepreneurial thinking through the lens of innovation. Throughout my career, I’ve worked across diverse innovation ecosystems—including the Cybersecurity & AI Lab, Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, and BNP Paribas Cardif’s Innovation Lab. I’ve led technical work in European cybersecurity projects such as AUTOKEY, SecureFog, PHY2APP, and UltraSec, contributing to advancements in privacy-preserving authentication, secure device onboarding, and post-quantum readiness. I actively contribute to global discussions through NIST activities, EU-level working groups such as the 5G and 6G Security Working Groups, and attend top-ranked conferences including USENIX, ACM MobiSys, and IEEE GLOBECOM.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading and writing—preferably with a strong Americano (two shots). In 2016, I published my first book, a personal travelogue capturing stories from across borders.
